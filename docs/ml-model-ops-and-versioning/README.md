# Model Operations and Versioning

There are two labs in this module:

- [Updating Model Deployments](deployment-model-updates.md) - Update an online model deployment to expose a new model, without affecting the end users/consumers of the endpoint.
- [Moving Assets Across Environments](deployment-asset-operations.md) - Organizations will likely have multiple environments for development, testing and production to deploy their models. This lab shows how assets can be moved (i.e "promoted") from one space to another.
