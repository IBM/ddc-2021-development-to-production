# Machine Learning Model Deployments, Inferencing and Integration

There are three labs in this module:

- [Online Deployment](online-model-deployment.md) - Create a REST endpoint for your model that you can use for near real time inferencing (predictions)
- [Batch Deployment](batch-model-deployment.md) - Create an endpoint to submit groups of payload data (either inline or as data assets) using jobs to your model for predictions.
- [Application Integration of Online Deployment](sample-application-integration.md) - Integrate an online deployment endpoint to a sample end user application.
