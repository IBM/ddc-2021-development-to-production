In this course/workshop for the IBM Digital Developer Conference: Data & AI, we get hands-on experience building and deploying machine learning models. We will look at a variety of topics in the development to production lifecycle. This will include: data processing, automated model development tools, approaches to model deployment, versioning of model deployments, movement of models across environments and trust in AI.
